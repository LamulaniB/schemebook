<p>Use this table below to customize your own scheme book. Please be advised that some sections of your scheme book will <br> 
be automatically generated during the rendering process, such as references and methods and activities <br>
since they  are heavily depended on the other sections of your scheme book. Also note that you can edit your final scheme book to fully <br>
customize it to your actual settings.
